I recorded podcast episodes with [Radical AI](https://www.radicalai.org/bias-in-nlp) and [Rasa Chats](https://anchor.fm/rasachats/episodes/Who-Does-NLP-Work-For--Fairness-and-Access-e100r9f)!

[Alexandra Olteanu](https://www.aolteanu.com/) and I recorded a webinar, [Failures of imagination: Discovering and measuring harms in language technologies](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/failures-of-imagination-discovering-and-measuring-harms-in-language-technologies/).

Our work was cited in Gretchen McCulloch's awesome [Because Internet](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/540664/because-internet-by-gretchen-mcculloch/).

Our work was described in the MIT Technology Review! [AI Programs Are Learning to Exclude Some African-American Voices](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608619/ai-programs-are-learning-to-exclude-some-african-american-voices/).

At UMass, I was involved with CS Women and Graduate Women in STEM and helped to organize a [Male Allyship Workshop](https://github.com/thelimeburner/cics-male-allyship-workshops) in fall 2017.

[In this interview for the UMass Women in Science video series, I briefly describe my work and my journey to computer science.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZMX8mb1ln8)
