I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics (FATE)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/fate/) group at [Microsoft Research Montréal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-montreal/). I'm broadly interested in examining the social implications of natural language processing technologies. My research currently focuses on conceptualizing harms arising from language technologies, better measuring these harms and other social impacts, and uncovering how they are are produced, especially assumptions and constraints surrounding their production. I've also worked on using NLP approaches to examine language variation and change (computational sociolinguistics), for example developing models to identify language variation on social media.

<!-- I've worked on developing models to identify language variation on social media, on applying lessons from sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology to conceptualizing harms arising from NLP systems, and on using the language of measurement modeling to rigorously analyze approaches to quantifying bias in NLP. -->

Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst working in the [Statistical Social Language Analysis Lab](http://slanglab.cs.umass.edu/) under the guidance of [Brendan O'Connor](http://brenocon.com/), where I was also supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. I received my B.A. in mathematics from Wellesley College. I interned at [Microsoft Research New York](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-york/) in summer 2019, where I was very fortunate to work with Solon Barocas, Hal Daumé III, and Hanna Wallach.
